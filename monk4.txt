Logline:
The re-incarnation of Joan of Arc,
now reborn as a Katana-wielding Ninja,
persuades an Ancient Drunken Master, 
who bumbles his way into Enlightenment, 
to help her save Humanity's Soul at
The End of Time.


                                FADE IN

EXT. NEAR THE PEAK OF A COLOSSAL MOUNTAIN

High-altitude view into INFINITE SKY, as if
looking out from the peak of EVEREST.

The BLEEDING HAND of THE GIRL grasps an
outcropping of JAGGED ROCK as she strains
to PULL herself up, punished by ice and wind,
until she COLLAPSES on a LEDGE.

            THE GIRL
        (exhausted)
    I'm no fool, you know.

CUT TO: DRONE SHOT OF THE GIRL's BACK

Simultaneously REVEALING the futuristic handle
of a PLASMA KATANA strapped there and
THE MONK, meditating on the tiny ledge in
perfect LOTUS-POSITION.

            THE MONK
    And I'm no wise old Bodhisattva!

            THE GIRL
    There is no one else with The Answer.

            THE MONK
    No one else is capable of asking The 
    Right Question.
        (smiling slowly)

            THE GIRL
    The time for koans is over!
        (collecting herself)
    I need to know.
    What will happen to this World?

            THE MONK
        (falling into reverie)
    You remind me of myself as a young
    acolyte.

EXT. ANCIENT TEMPLE GROUNDS

Abuzz with the everyday sacerdotal duties
of a HOLY ORDER, a lowly NOVITIATE (CHILD MONK) 
strains under his YOKE of water.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    Agitating my Master with endless
    questions. What a sycophantic
    little weasel I was back then!

A PRIEST rolls his eyes at the child monk
before WALKING away.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    After the Great Typhoon, our Temple
    lay in shambles. All of the nearby
    villages as well, flooded into ruin.

Scenes of flattened, drenched DEVASTATION,
as the child monk picks up a cracked PRAYER
WHEEL out of the muck.

The child monk SPOTS his Master in the distance, 
fetching a BUCKET of water from a now 
OVERFLOWING WELL, and performing his usual 
MORNING ABLUTIONS.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    And when I saw him going about his prayer
    rituals, in the same manner as he had
    before this infernal deluge.
    I knew I had to ask him.

INTERRUPTS the priest's CHANTING.

            CHILD MONK
    Why could we not be spared, Master?

            PRIEST
        (beatific)
    Is it so? We have not been spared?

CUT BACK TO: EXT. THE MONK'S MOUNTAIN LEDGE

DRAWING her KATANA from its sheath and ACTIVATING
it, she SWINGS it to within an inch of his 
CAROTID ARTERY.

The BLADE is silent as it PULSATES and RADIATES.
But as SNOWFLAKES hit its ENERGY BEAM, they
EVAPORATE into hissing STEAM.

            THE GIRL
        (fury incarnate)
    Don't make me avenge him!

A FLASH of something in his crystalline GAZE,
regret or perhaps something more STRANGE.


            THE GIRL (CONT'D)
    Oh yes! It is a tale well told
    where I come from. The wise old 
    man of the mountain. And his fool 
    for a student!

Certain PECULIARITIES about his appeance now
begin to make themselves KNOWN to her:

The small CIRCLE surrounding him is COMPLETELY
DRY, devoid of any of the ice and snow which
covers the landscape.

His ROBE, woven from the thinnest TUSSA SILK,
wrapped LOOSELY about his bare skin, appears to
keep him warm and sheltered, despite the wintry
elements.

Long strands of his HAIR, plunging well below
his shoulders, lie UTTER STILL in the chaotic
GUSTS of bone-chilling wind.

Even his FEET, shoeless in the frigid air, shod
only in a single layer of BATIK COTTON, appear
utterly IMPERVIOUS to frostbite.

Under that flowing robe, an almost imperceptible
VIBRATION emanates from his body, as if he were
LEVITATING an inch or two off of that 
inhospitable terrain!

            THE GIRL (CON'T)
    A drunkard capable of draining an
    entire vineyard! A gambler who would
    stake his own child in a wager! But
    even that wretch of an underling who
    left his family to train with you.
    Who put his absolute faith in you.
    Did not deserve...
        (catching herself)
    But I did not make a journey of a 
    thousand miles just to condemn.

She TWISTS around to REPLACE the sword
on her back.

And in the same MOMENT, he TURNS behind his
own back to RETRIEVE and PLACE in front of
them a full, piping-hot TEA SERVICE on an
antique lacquered tray.

She sits on the wild silk CUSHION that has
materialized before her as if by magic.

The sight of fresh GREEN TEA and BALO BAO
(pineapple cakes) before her are too much
of a temptation to resist.

            THE MONK
    Don't be polite!
    Enjoy!

            THE GIRL
        (munching between hearty gulps)
    "Never flowers over dumplings..."

            THE MONK
    Ah! These are just like the ones
    the Princess Retainer used to 
    serve at River Bridge during
    Cherry Blossom Festival. I 
    suppose you are too young to
    remember?

            THE GIRL
        (mouth full)
    Nnmmppff!

            THE MONK
        (musing)
    Once, in the old Capitol, 
    surrounded by the cultural and
    political elite, I accidentally
    challenged the Emporer's most
    prized wrestler to a bout.

            THE GIRL
        (spewing crumbs)
    What! You! The Senpai of Peace! 
    Wrestling!

CUT TO: INT. WRESTLING RING OF IMPERIAL PALACE

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    When the time came to meet in
    the fighting circle, I was
    terrified.

BRONZEN OX, the Emporer's most prized wrestler,
STANDS at one side, while at the other we SEE
the monk, a little older than last time, but
still not yet an adult.

A REFEREE stands between them, looking
a little WORRIED.

They are SURROUNDED by a THRONG of FANATICS,
ARISTOCRATS, RETAINERS, and PUBLICANS, who
are at the peak of PANDEMONIUM, waiting for
the action to commence.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    One look at "Bronzen Ox" was enough
    to know...I would be shown no mercy!

The Ox does his ELABORATE pre-fight RITUAL,
a few SQUATS, then SHAKING one leg after the other.

While the monk begins to CONTROL his breathing
FOCUSING his mind.

The considerable CROWD which has gathered takes
part in ceremonial JESTING and TAUNTS the
statue-like monk.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    It was then I noticed deep in the
    crowd, the Old Bookie taking side bets
    Apparently there were quite a few takers
    sensing a "sure thing."

While a few FLUNKIES quabble with the bookie
over terms, a tall PATRICIAN looks around
before taking an enormous wad of BILLS out
from between his flowing ROBES.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    None dared to bet me to win. But were
    wagering magnificent sums on how
    long I would last.
            (excitedly)
    An idea came to me!
    
CALLS the Bookie over to him in a voice
loud enough to be heard over the din.

The INTERRUPTED Bookie shuffles his way
THROUGH the crowd and INTO the ring.

            OLD BOOKIE
    What?

            YOUNG MONK
        (confidently)
    May I bet on myself?

The crowd ERUPTS in laughter.

            OLD BOOKIE
    In this case, i can make an exception.

            YOUNG MONK
    One Gold Tallin!

The crowd is HUSHED immediately.

The Ox stops EXERCISING, foot BALANCED in mid-air.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    Those wheels in his mind began turing.

            THE OX (V.O.)
        (internally)
    Maybe that poor monk *does* know something
    about fighting...

CALLING the referee over, Bronzen Ox BENDS down
and WHISPERS something into her ear.

The referee WALKS over to the monk's corner
and GRABS his WRIST, LIFTING it high into the air.

            REFEREE
    Ox forfeits! I present the victor!

The Old Bookie, attempting to escape, is THRUST
back into the ring by the UPROARIUS crowd, and
comes FACE-TO-FACE with the young monk, BEAMING.

CUT BACK TO: EXT. MONK'S LEDGE

POURING the last of the tea into her cup, 
THE GIRL swallows it down in a single gulp, 
before letting out a tiny HICCUP.

SATIATED, she reclines fully SUPINE and
RELAXED on the brocade pillow.

            THE GIRL
    "Time reveals a person's character."

            THE MONK
    Yessss. So?

            THE GIRL
    Is that the moral? Of the wrestling story.

            THE MONK
    The point is that after that incident I
    gained a modicum of respect. And folks
    started listening to me...
            (clearing tea service)

            THE GIRL
        (sensing an opening)
    If you choose to help me.
    All will bow before you in gratitude.
        (beat)

            THE MONK
    Are you really here? Reclining on
    my ledge, asking me to come down the
    mountain. How do I know this isn't
    a dream?

In one INSTANT, she FLICKS a small pebble
with her foot and then THRUSTS it in the 
direction of the monk's face using her
flawless OPEN HAND technique.

The monk CATCHES the stone between two FINGERS.

            THE GIRL
    You should have let it hit you!
    Then you would know, that in this land
    there is no such thing as pleasant 
    dreams anymore.

            THE MONK
        (ruminating once again)
    I once had quite a renown for dream
    interpretation... 

CUT TO: EXT. OLD PORT CITY

HUSTLE of TRADERS from across the Seven Seas
that have come to PLY their exotic wares.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    How bustling the Old Port used to
    be in those days! I had gotten it
    on good advice that the best way for
    a budding seeker to understand The
    Way was not to hole oneself in the
    Temple away from life. But to immerse
    oneself right in the heart of it!

A FIGHT breaks out over a DISPUTE among
BUYERS and SELLERS.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    And like the timeless Sadhus who
    left the jungle and created the
    First City, I dived right into it!

In the CENTER, the monk in POWER POSE, 
dressed not in ascetic robes, but 
vibrant, PROSPEROUS style, ACTING as 
unofficial MEDIATOR.

            CITY MONK
    Twenty silver, no less is fair!

A MESSENGER arrives and bids CITY MONK
to FOLLOW him, which he does POST HASTE.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    I was summoned to provide my 
    divination skills at the office
    of a powerful company Kaiju.

INT. THE SUPERB JUTE COMPANY HQ

            THE MONK (V.O)
    When I arrived at his regal, yet
    chaotic, inner offices he bade me,
    in front of all his most senior
    lieutenants, to interpret the most
    peculiar dream he had just 
    experienced during his mid morning
    nap.

            1ST LIEUTENANT
    This is he, Kaiju. The one they all
    say has the power of foresight.

            2ND LIEUTENANT
    You must take an oath of absolute 
    secrecy. Whatever you hear in this 
    room...

            CITY MONK
    No oaths! My only Master is Truth!

As the rest of the lieutenants attempt to
PROTEST, they are HUSHED by the KAIJU.

            KAIJU
        (clearly shaken)
    It's ok. I must know...

            CITY MONK
    Calm yourself, Kaiju. Focus your
    breathing and coax your mind into
    remembering all that happened...

EXT. CENTRAL HUB STREET, OLD PORT CITY

            KAIJU (V.O.)
    I was an impoverished beggar,
    panhandling in the street for
    scraps of food and any bits of 
    copper I could scrounge.

SWELL of crowds lining the street
PARTS to REVEAL Kaiju (as BEGGAR)
holding a RUSTY CUP outstreched.

            KAIJU (V.O.)
    Although the streets were brimming
    with the fashionable people of the
    day, not one would hand me a penny!

His FACE a PINNACLE of SUFFERING as he
is AVOIDED, IGNORED and SPAT UPON.

            KAIJU (V.O.)
    Though I suplicated myself. Pleading.
    It was as though my very existence was
    an affront to the good and gentle folk.
    Finally, I reached the peak of crisis.

COLLAPSING unto the ground in a HEAP,
the crowds CONTINUE their way, stepping
OVER and AROUND him.

UNTIL, a CURATE in elaborate robes STOPS
and HELPS the beggar to his knees.

            KAIJU (V.O.)
    I sensed an all-pervading warmth and
    feeling of hope course through my body.
    Who could this be? Just as I was about
    to inquire, he pointed directly at my
    shoddy attire and bade me...

            CURATE
        (commanding)
    Undress!

CROWD now begins to notice.

            KAIJU (V.O.)
    I refused him, of course, but as
    he grew more insistent, I found I was
    powerless to resist him!

FILTHY RAGS drop to dusty street as the 
ONLOOKERS let out a collective GASP.

            KAIJU (V.O.)
    To my surprise, my skin wasn't skin
    at all! Nor my flesh flesh! 

PAN to see the unshod form of the beggar,
his body now composed of PURE SOLID GOLD!

MOVING his lustrous hands and ams before
his face in AMAZEMENT, great shiny SCALES
of gold begin to SHED from the skin and
COLLECT on the street below.

Waves of the people assembled begin to 
APPROACH him with large WOVEN BASKETS.
CATCHING the treasure before it can
hit the ground.

In the distance, a VAST HORDE approaches,
each armed with enormous BLADES they SHARPEN
by RUBBING against each other.

            KAIJU (V.O)
    They were coming for my very skin!

CUT BACK TO: INT. KAIJU's OFFICES

            CITY MONK
    And it was at this point you bolted
    awake, correct?

            KAIJU
    Yes! Oh, what can it mean?

            CITY MONK
    Well, it's obvious.

The assembled lieutenants begin to LEAN IN
so they may catch every word.

            1ST LIEUTENANT
    What? You already know what it means?

RETURN CUT TO: EXT. MONK'S LEDGE

            THE GIRL
        (confused)
    Wait a minute.

            THE MONK
    You are at a total loss for what such
    a dream could possibly mean. Lot harder
    than it sounds, isn't it?

            THE GIRL
    Er no, it's pretty obvious. I'm just
    curious what method of interpretation
    you use to analyze the dream.

            THE MONK
    Well, I don't know if I would really call
    it a method. In this case, I sensed that Fortune
    was placing a great opportunity before me. And 
    I intended to seize it!

            THE GIRL
    Fortune favors those who prey upon the
    gullibility of the ruling class!
    
            THE MONK
    I had to choose my words very carefully. All those
    people there, word would spread very quickly if
    I offered some unpopular explanation.
    My reputation hung in the balance.

            THE GIRL
    So you don't actually interpret anything.
    You just tell people what they want to hear.
    And charge a great deal for the service?

            THE MONK
    No! I mean...
        (throws her a baleful look)
    Let me finish my tale.
    
RETURN CUT TO: INT. KAIJU'S OFFICES

            2ND LIEUTENANT
    Please if you know! Tell us!

            CITY MONK
    The Goddess of Prosperity is angry.

BALEFUL LOOKS exchanged between the lieutenants.

            KAIJU
    My Goddess! You're right!

            1ST LIEUTENANT
    That would explain the wharf fires...

            2ND LIEUTENANT
    And the mold!

            KAIJU
    But how do we...appease Her?

            CITY MONK
    You must take one percent of your wealth
    and form a Pool. Then ask the other city
    patrons to contribute one percent and
    add it the Pool. Using these funds, a
    Great Fortune Temple is to be erected,
    complete with pyres and round the clock
    offerings!

            KAIJU
        (his old boss self)
    Yes!

Assembled lieutenants CHEERING and CONGRATULATING.

FOCUS on the city monk massaging his chin in thought.

            CITY MONK
        (gazing skyward)
    There's only one problem though...
    We need to appoint a High Priest,
    someone Pure in Faith whom we can trust
    in absolutely...

CUT TO: EXT. GREAT FORTUNE TEMPLE

FOOTMEN carry a great palanquin on which
sits CITY MONK,now transformed into 
TEMPLE MONK, resplendent in priestly robes.

PRIESTESSES STREW the path with ROSE PETALS while 
BURNT OFFERINGS send smoke upward unto the HEAVENS.

INT. FORTUNE TEMPLE'S GODDESS CHAMBER

TEMPLE MONK administers rites to CITY ELDERS now
clad in CEREMONIAL DRESS.

RETURNING from a DEEP BOW back to UPRIGHT position
is KAIJU, his face the PORTRAIT of RAPTURE.

LIBATION BEARERS ASSIST in the rites as TEMPLE
MONK performs a MAGIC FEAT for show.

CUT BACK TO: EXT. MONK'S MOUNTAIN LEDGE

            THE MONK
    I was an illustrious temple high priest.
    The city flourished in all aspects of
    culture and commerce uder my watch.
    Right up until The End.

            THE GIRL
    Well, you certainly can't be blamed for that.

She RECLINES on the pillow, flat on her back
and GAZING up at the CLOUDS which have begun to 
part and show the faint GLIMMER of the sun.

            THE GIRL
    Master, may I ask a personal thing?

            THE MONK
    What can be private to One who has no Ego?

            THE GIRL
    When was the last time a woman visited you
    in your little hermitage in the mountains.

            THE MONK
    What does it matter to One lives every moment
    according to the Law of Kama Shastra?
    Which reminds me...

            THE GIRL
    Again?

    Lake District Beauty"

SLOW DISSOLVE TO: LOTUS LAKE DISTRICT - NIGHT

BRILLIANT FULL MOON shines over sleepy hamlet
nestled on the shores of an UNDISTURBED LAKE

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    She came into this World under the Autumn
    Peach Moon in that long Season of Armistice
    between the Great Warring Parties.

INT. LAKE NURSERY

SCREAMS rend the air, as an OLD DOULA helps
a MOTHER deliver her birthing BABY.

            DOULA
    How like a Water Nymph she is!

            MOTHER
    We'll call her "Sei"...

EXT. LAKE DISTRICT PLAYGROUND

CHILDREN frenziedly playing a BALL GAME,
when suddenly the ball POPS out of the
huddle and into CHILD SEI who quickly
SCORES a GOAL from way, way down town,
as SPECTATORS CHEER.

            ONLOOKER
        (to her parents)
    A good Omen!

INT. LAKE DISTRICT TEMPLE

The village's YOUTHS, dressed in ceremonial
robes receive their first SACRAMENT.

When it is YOUNG SEI's turn, the assembled
CONGREGATION beams with PRIDE.

INT. SEI'S MOTHER'S HOME
    
An ELDER WOMAN and her ADULT SON, dressed in
finery, sit siffly on a low bed serving as
makeshift couch. SEI and her MOTHER kneel
on the dirt floor before them.

            WOMAN
        (condescending)
    I bet it was difficult to raise her
    without her father present.

            MOTHER
    No not at all. As you can see she is
    the Pride of our Village.

            WOMAN
    Lift your face up girl! 
    What do you think my boy?

            SON
    She is a Water Nymph come to Life! 

            WOMAN
    I guess that is it then. 
        (tiny flash of jealousy) 
    Congratulations!
    We accept your daughter as child bride to my
    second son. In one month's time you may bring
    her to the Palace. Come on...
        (rising)
    We have a long journey back!

EXT. PINE PALACE OUTER GATE - DAWN

Morning at the Palace appears STILL and SILENT,
as a CARRIAGE awaits in front of two GREAT DOORS.
The breath of two HORSES visible in the chill.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    Although heartbroken to see her go,
    passing up the prospect of a regal life for her
    daughter would have caused great shame.
    But life at her new house turned sour soon
    after the honeymoon.

SUDDENLY the doors SLAM open, and SEI, now a young 
lady, bursts out, disheveled, with tears and a 
BLOODY GASH upon her forehead.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    Jealousy was now her handmaid. Her husband
    though completely in love with her asked
    if she might live instead at the University,
    where she might learn to grow in knowledge
    as she had continued to do in lovliness.

She races into the carriage as it 
DRIVES off hurriedly.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    It was a great sacrifice to even be apart
    from her for even one night. But he looked
    forward to visiting her at school. And
    besides, there was unrest in the Western
    provinces, and the Emporer's Guards had
    called him into duty. And he knew Sei
    would be tormented staying at the palace.

Sei's Husband DONS his princely armor.

EXT. CAMPUS, THE HUNDRED SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT

Excited STUDENTS deep in discussion RACE 
to lectures amidst the breathtaking fall 
foliage, as we see SEI, in uniform,
CLIMB the steps of an enormous dormitory.

INT. SEI'S ROOM, SAGE DORMITORY

MESSENGER with eyes cast DOWNWARDS, waits
and REACTS upon her arrival, delivering a
SEALED scroll with the PALACE INSIGNIA.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    But her true curse lay in her reciprocal
    love.

SEI RIPS the scroll OPEN and begins READING.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    For she came to love those who fell in 
    love with her, with an equal and all
    consuming intesity.

LOOKING UP at the messenger, who WEEPS, she
FALLS to the hard FLOOR.

EXT. BATTLEGROUND OF THE WISTERIA RIVER SKIRMISH

CLOSE UP on the lifeless viasge of SEI's
husband, felled in a mighty campaign.

INT. GREAT LIBRARY STUDY HALL

Stacks of FOLIOS sit before SEI as she
WRITES quickly in a manuscript.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    To assuage her grief she plunged deep into
    focused study. Switching from the topics
    that had interested her before, classical
    poetry and music, to religion and philosophy.

INT. HONORARY DEBATE AUDITORIUM

Two imposing INTELLECTS stand at twin lecterns
in the midst of a heated CONTEST of WITS. 

TRANSFIXED, Sei sits in the front row of
SPECTATORS, her note pad completely blank.

INT. THOUSAND SCHOOLS MAIN DINING HALL

BUSY dinner service is playing out with
SERVERS, BUSERS, STUDENTS, LECTURERS,
and DONS. 

All present enjoy FEASTING on suptuous spreads.

Occasional TOASTS of a glass of CHERRY WINE
are made to congratulate academic TRIUMPHS.

SLOW PAN DOWN to FOCUS on Sei, with the two
DEBATERS from before, intensely CHATTING.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    At the time there were two main divisions
    regarding the teaching of The Way. 

FOCUS on YO, one of the debaters, TALKING
animatedly. He possesses a QUIRKY, yet 
MESMERIC demeanor.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    "The True Path" sought to extinguish all
    entanglements with The World. Through
    vigorous ascetic practice and constant
    inscribing of the Sutras, its tenets
    sought Inner Perfection.

FOCUS on UTA, Yo's rival in the forensic arts.
Though SERENE and DETERMINED looking, his eyes
BLAZE with MIRTHFUL energy.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    And in the other corner, "Cosmic Oneness."
    A teaching that sought direct experience of
    matters unknowable by reason via chanting
    and the occasional full moon bacchanal.

EXT. ACADEMY OF PHYSICAL CULTURE

Sei SITS between Uta and Yo as they boisterously
CHEER the home team at a spirited BADMINTON match.

INT. DULCET MUSICAL PAVILLION

The three take in the dolorous tones of a BLIND
TWO-STRING FIDDLE player, tears STREAMING down
their faces.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    Sei began to reflect on the Nature of the
    deep Love that was blossoming between them.
    She rationed that if she could somehow
    give herself equally to both of them, she
    would escape the inevitable curse of jealousy
    that plagued her in the past.

INT. DINING ROOM OF YO'S APARTMENTS

Sei is serving a romantic candle-lit dinner she
has cooked. For the three of them.

As the offer a prayer, DEEP GLANCES are exchanged.

INT. STUDY ROOM OF YO'S APARTMENTS

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    She even believed she had discovered a bridge
    between the different paths guiding The Way.

Sei WRITES furiously and finishes a page, PLACING
it at the bottom of a short stack of other finished
pages.

The top sheet of paper has the TITLE: 
"The Threefold Doctrine of Compassion"

Uta ENTERS and TAKES a page from the sheaf. 
He begins READING, casually at first, then INTENTLY.

Yo follows in soon after, holding a tray of BARLEY TEA
and THREE CUPS.

The group LAUGHS at a COMMENT Uta makes, 
gesticulating PASSIONATELY.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    
    This bliss was short lived, however.
    For The Way is One Thing. But followers
    of The Way, that is Another Thing altogether!

EXT. COSMIC BACCHANAL 

In a great circle sits a THRONG of revelers
passing an enormous BRONZE GU (long goblet) around.
Each takes a hearty gulp before passing it onwards.

DANCING and SINGING ensue among the participants.

But in the midst of the frey, the three lovers QUARREL.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    And when emotions are uninhibited by our
    usual defenses, true character always outs!

Uta and Yo take turns GRABBING Sei's arm, pulling
her this way and that. Until she THROWS up her hands
and LEAVES hurriedly.

EXT. HILLSIDE OF FACULTY HUNTING GROUNDS

PISTOLS at DAWN.

Uta and Yo STAND ten paces from each other.
And TURN to FIRE...

INT. CHANCELLOR's INNER ALCOVE

The college DEAN stands grim before Sei, as
she PLEADS before him.

            SEI
        (weeping)
    Please may I stay. I have no where else...

Dean SHAKES his head "No" without looking at her,
eyes cast downward in pity and grief over the
entire tragic incident.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    Giving up all hope now, Sei sought sanctuary
    in the one place that could not refuse her.


EXT. TEMPLE OF LAST REFUGE

Sei speaks with a SUPERIOR NUN at the gate,
pleading to be let in.

The nun grudgingly ACCEPTS and the gate SLAMS 
shut behind her.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    But even this would prove disastrous.

Nun is WALKING Sei through the somewhat unkempt
grounds.

INT. HIGH PRIEST'S SANCTUM

The moment the FATHER SUPERIOR is introduced
to Sei, a far-away LOOK comes into his
formerly austere GAZE.

EXT. GARDEN OF THE POOR

MONKS fight over who gets to FETCH Sei
a pale of water, pluck weeds from her pea garden.

INT. LENDING LIBRARY

NUNS TRANSCRIBING prayer scrolls NEGLECT their
work, and BICKER over who will help Sei clean
her ink-stained brushes.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    Sei made a vow to herself. To give herself, 
    freely and equally now. To all who asked 
    even the slightest thing of her. For again
    it was her curse to love those who loved her!

High Preist ENTERS wishing to CONVERSE with Sei
and joins in the FIGHTING.

EXT. TEMPLE REMAINS

The former gate now lies broken. Vegetation has
begun to reclaim the once tended grounds.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
   And when that too failed. Sei resigned herself
   to a life of singular hardship.

EXT. ONYX RIVER PLATINUM MINE

A giant manmade HORESHOE has been carved out of a
mammoth MOUNTAIN, with a mighty RIVER the color
of the night sky RUSHING beside it.

Everywhere the signs of great mining operation,
systems of pulleys, wooden derricks reaching to
the sky, and countless WORKERS moving endless
tonnage of rocks and ore.

A FOREMAN paces before a batch of new RECRUITS.

FOCUS on one in particular, face and hands covered
in cloth wrappings to protect from the sulfur fumes,
we see only her EYES peeking through and recognize
them as Sei's.

            FOREMAN
        (forceful)
    Welcome to Hell on Earth! I don't know 
    how you got here, and I don't care. We exist
    to provide the Emporer with precious platinum.
    And that is the only reason why we exist. So
    drop your Egos by the river's edge and let the
    current wash them away to the land of the living!
    For you are already dead here. And whatever sins 
    you indulged in while alive, they are your debt 
    now. A debt to be repayed in metal!

MONTAGE sequence of PLATINUM REFINEMENT PROCESS, 
from ore to finished LUSTROUS ingot.

DIGGERS way underground PICKAXE a sparkly chunk of ore.

LONG CHAIN of CARTERS, ROPERS, and HAULERS bring the
ore to the SURFACE, where it GLISTENS in the overcast sky.

SMASHERS take turns HAMMERING the ore with immense MALLETS,
rendering it into tiny bits as dust SPRAYS everywhere.

GRINDERS use great circular stones to PULVERIZE what
remains into a fine DAZZLING powder.

SMELTERS blow hot air using immense BELLOWS into 
FURNACES atop which sit enormous CRUCIBLES.

CASTERS pour the fiery liquid into open clay pots,
where it cools instantly. As the pots are hammered away
the final form is revealed: precious platinum bars...

White gloved ATTENDANTS wipe off any stray debris and
carry the finished bars to the POLISHERS who WASH
and SHEEN the bars with fine cloths until it SHINES.

Finally they are carried one-buy-one past a row of
BOOKKEEPERS with great leather-bound LEDGERS in which
they record every detail, and placed in the VAULT,
where MILLIONS of bars lie stacked to the ceiling!

QUICK PAN BACK to new recruits, looking anxious or
resigned, except Sei, whose luminous eyes reveal a
look of RELIEF as she leats out a DEEP SIGH.

INT. WORKER's TENT - EVENING

A MEDIC makes the rounds of laborers, who after a
long day of mining, are full of complaints.

The medic holds a great bucket of PANTHER BALM
and a HORSE HAIR BRUSH that seems to be his cure
all for every ailment.

One unwraps the rags he has around his hands that
function as makeshift gloves, revealing CRACKED
and BLISTERED hands which the medic swipes with
his brush dupped liberally in the ointment.

When the medic gets to Sei, her face still covered,
she shakes her head "No" and looks away as he moves
down the row.

INT WORKER'S TENT - LATE NIGHT

SNORES of sleeping laborers fill the tent.

As Sei, wide awake, removes the rags from her own
hands.

Instead of the rough, calloused skin we are expecting.
They are flawless in complexion.

Sei BURIES her uncovered face in her perfect, 
beautiful hands, and begins SILENTLY WEEPING.

EXT. MINE RIVER BANK - DEMOLITION SITE

Foreman DIRECTS a crew setting up a SHAPE CHARGE to
blow a new section of the mountain for excavation.

They PLACE the charge with utmost CAUTION, aware
of their PROXIMITY to the rushing waters.

Many meters down stream fomr the site, Sei WASHES
a set of excavation tools in a gully.

Crew scatters to positions along the bank of the
river as Foreman BEGINS a COUNT DOWN.

ZOOM IN on the dynamite as we hear:

            FOREMAN
    Three! Two! One! BLAST IT!!!

But before he finishes, the charge TIPS OVER 
in the final second and LIES FLAT in its enclosure.

SCREAMS of caution from the assembled crew, but 
it is too late!

EXPLOSION rips away from the mountain, TOSSING
some of the crew into the RAPIDS!

As they are HURLED down stream at break neck
speeds, some try to LATCH on to the banks.

But others, SWEPT in the mighy current, go DOWN
and are never seen again.

Sei now RUNS to the edge and SEES Foreman
passing, she STRETCHES out her arm.

Grown STRONG from her labors, she is able
with great combined EFFORT, to pull him
ashore.

SOAKED but alive, he sits PANTING in the mud.
His expression of GRATITUDE begins MELTING
into something DEEPER. 

Sei LIFTS her hands to her face and relaizes 
with HORROR, her mask and scarves have 
WASHED AWAY in the TUSSLE.

EXT. ABANDONED PLATINUM MINE

Collapsed into the mountain, the REMNANTS of 
the once productive operation are now vacated.

BROKEN tools and wood scaffolds BURNT to cinders
are all that remains.

The sound of FOOTSTEPS approach as the SCOUTS 
of an INVADING ARMY claim the mine, PLANTING
a BANNER in its scarred earth.

            THE MONK (V.O.)
    It was at this point in her tale,
    destiny saw fit to cross our paths.

EXT. LOTUS LAKE

Sei, more LOVELY than ever, APPEARS at
the water's edge.

DRESSED in a pure white robe of PONGEE SILK
she GAZES out into the water.

FLOATING on a giant LILY PAD, surrounded by
LOTUS BLOSSOMS in the peak of full bloom
sits The Monk!

Older now, in brilliant SAFFRON ROBES,
head fully SHAVED but still recognizable.

He flawlessly EXECUTES his classic 
Lotus-position MEDITATION STANCE.

The water surrounding him lies UTTERLY STILL.

            LAKE MONK
    You have come here to end all 
    suffering. Is that not right?

            SEI
    Some are beyond saving.

She takes a single STEP into the lake,
sending a long SLOW RIPPLE across its
surface, colliding with the monk's seat.

REFRACTING ripples BOUNCE in all directions
as a slight GUST OF AIR blows Sei's long
hair from her eyes, REVEALING her full face
to the monk's gaze.

            LAKE MONK
        (his breath catching)
    Water Nymph!

The immaculate and perfect BALANCE the monk
was previously attaining on his delicate 
lily pad is being slightly UPENDED by his
LOSS OF CONCENTRATION.

The LILY PAD begins to SLOSH about
SINKING slightly into the perturbated water.

            SEI
        (tiniest whisper)
    No!

The monk FOCUSES and REGAINS his concentration.
His BALANCE and POWER are REVITALIZED!

            LAKE MONK
        (knowingly)
    No.

Sei takes another STEP in to the lake.

            SEI
        (preternaturally calm)
    Gentle Monk, I am sorry you must
    bear witness to my fate...

            LAKE MONK
    Jealousy has been your handmaid
    since birth. Strife and chaos
    your constant companions.

            SEI
        (resigned)
    And destruction...devastation!

            LAKE MONK
    Even Death! Say no more...

Sei now WAIST DEEP continues ADVANCING.

            SEI
    Can you understand, Wise Monk?
    Why I must do this? Before I
    bring about the End of All Life?

            LAKE MONK
    I understand...
        (beat)
    But please, wait one minute more.
    For what is one minute of Joy by the lake?
    Compared to one thousand centuries
    in Form-less Limbo!

With the water UP TO her shoulders, Sei
SHIVERS slightly from the temperature,
as she STEELS herself for the FINAL PLUNGE.

            SEI
    Goodbye, Honorable Monk.

But, she PAUSES.

           THE MONK
    "Only a living corpse neither advances
    nor retreats!"

            SEI
    If you don't mind? This is no time
    for koans. A bit of silence respectfully...

            THE MONK
    Well, get on with it then!

            SEI
    Pardon me?

            THE MONK
        (pensive)
    I was an orphan you know, and entered the
    Temple as a baby.
    
            SEI
    Would you kindly shut up?
    
            THE MONK
    My Master! Nothing phased him back then!
    Not even the Great Typhoon!

            SEI
    If only I could be so determined.

            THE MONK
    It was the first thing I remember.
    A Novice came to my Master in tears.
    He said he had contemplated The Way for
    three whole weeks! Pausing only to sleep.
    And since he still had not found His Path,
    he must return to his village in shame!
    But my Master told him: "meditate three
    more days, and if you still don't find it,
    kill yourself!"

            SEI
    That's horrible! Why are you telling me this?

            THE MONK
    Because at that very moment, the student was
    Enlightened!

            SEI
        (softening)
    Really?

            THE MONK
    Sei?

            SEI
    Yes?

            THE MONK
    Have you ever tried not hiding your
    Dharma?

            SEI
    Not "hiding my Dharma?"

            THE MONK
    You have allowed every one else to love you.
    And loved every one reciprocally.
    But have you ever tried loving your Self
    as others have fallen in Love with you?

            SEI
        (long pause)
    That's your teaching?

            THE MONK
    Didn't work? You're still going to...

            SEI
        (laughing)
    You may be the worst monk in history!

            THE MONK
    I try.

            SEI
    No. Not really.

Sei now CLOSES her eyes, her lips tight, READY.

But immediately OPENS them again at the sound
of a GIANT SPLASH.

The monk has LEAPED into the water!

He makes his way through the shoulder-high
lake APPROACHING Sei, who is STUNNED. 
He TAKES her hand UNDER the WATER.

            LAKE MONK
    Come.

            SEI
    Where?

            LAKE MONK
    To Pureland!

            SEI
    Where is Pureland?

            LAKE MONK
    Beyond Time and Space! No one will
    bother you there! It is place devoid of
    jealousy, corruption, even sin! Come!

He LEADS her out of the WATER and onto
the SHORE, where two HORSES are waiting.

Sei notices, they are both COMPLETELY DRY!

            SEI
    How far is it?

EXT. GREAT DESERT

TELESCOPE SHOT of two horse back riders
pounding at full gallop through the alien terrain.

EXT. TEMPLE OF TRUTH IN BEAUTY, PURELAND

Perfect GIANT PYRAMID nestled in an EDENIC OASIS.

At its APEX, the GLOWING All-Seeing Eye!

And as its congregants: the IRREGULARS, 
the OUTCASTS, the MISFITS, and the FORGOTTON ONES.

All those who feel they do not BELONG in this World!

X-RAY ZOOM PAN THROUGH the pyramid walls and into:

INT. HALL OF WONDERS

Here are GATHERED the BLESSED and STRANGE
ARCANA of this World! 

A MUSEUM of UNEXPLANABLE NATURAL PHENOMENA.

For how better to UNLOCK the SECRETS of LIFE
than DELVING into its most MYSTERIOUS subjects!

HOLY MONK sits OBSERVING, arrayed in robes
woven with PLATINUM threads.

SEI SITS next to him, a Water Nymph come to Life!

A faint HALO of GOLD FORMS around HOLY MONK'S
bald head.

His THIRD EYE of COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS OPENS...

And He ASCENDS to the HIGHEST SEAT in the 
PANTHEON of ETERNAL KNOWING by the DIN of 
his RESOUNDING SPLENDOUR!

SMASH CUT BACK TO: MONK"S MOUNTAIN LEDGE

            THE GIRL
        (emotional)
    I understand...

            THE MONK
    Then you know. I never was at Lotus Lake
    that fateful day.

            THE GIRL
        (sobbing)
    I understand, Master!

            THE MONK
    We never made it to any "pure land."

EXT. SHALLOW WATER

Under the SURFACE we make out the FACE of
Sei with eyes CLOSED. 

SERENE. Finally at PEACE.

SUDDENLY, the eyes OPEN. 

SLOW DISSOLVE.

SOME MOMENTS LATER.

EXT. MONK'S LEDGE

The girl GATHERS the intricate RICE PAPER 
and FLAX RIBBON PACKAGES of provisions
the monk has MADE for her.

            THE MONK
    If it helps...
    I still don't really understand, "Why?"

            THE GIRL
    "The Way is One Thing..."

            THE MONK
    "And followers of The Way, quite another"
    Yes.

            THE GIRL
    Like your former student?

            THE MONK
        (shocked)
    What?

            THE GIRL
    Lo. Your former apprentice.
    The one you threw down the mountain...

        THE MONK
    I never...
        (wistful)
    I...
    Let's just say, I wished we shared a 
    different fate. It did not need to end
    the way it did...

        THE GIRL
    Then why don't you tell him yourself.

        THE MONK
    What? Do you mean...
    Tell him...
    (realizing)

The CLOUDS break now, and pure sunlight, 
unscattered by the thin climate, begins to 
BATHE his penitent face.

        THE MONK (CONT'D)
    How? I mean... 
    Where is he?

        THE GIRL
    Down below.

She turns now, WALKS determinedly toward the ledge.
And BRACES her courage for the rough return.

        THE GIRL (CONT'D)
    Who do you think told me about you?

KNEELING over the ledge, she LOWERS one foot down
to what we can only imagine to be a most 
precipitous DESCENT.

        THE GIRL
        (turning back)
    He's waiting for you...

As she DISAPPEARS over the edge, THE MONK begins 
to STAND. SHAKING first the LEFT LEG then the 
RIGHT LEG out. 

He performs a few WRESTLER-STYLE ceremonial
SQUATS for show.

Then SAUNTERS right up to the very TIP of the ledge.

Harsh ROCK meets brillant cobalt blue SKY that 
is now CLOUDLESS and ABLAZE with sunlight.

A DEEP BREATH.

Arms LIFTED in flawless SUN SALUTATION.

Before THE MONK executes a perfect SWAN DIVE 
off the cliff, and DOWN the mountain.

                FADE OUT.
