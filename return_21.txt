SC EXT. VENICE, ITALY - MORNING

AC On the Via Bazzerea, two Yellow Cabs drive listlessly toward
AC the Aero Porto Marco Polo, where they will enact their daily
AC morning ritual of vying for the lucrative tourist fares.

AC The drivers are YELLING at one another over a minor offense.

AC One brandishes a Toscanello cigar, extending it far out his
AC open window.

AC TIGHT ZOOM on the cigar's dimly-lit tip. 

AC A long finger of ash dangles from its end as a fine thread 
AC of Armangnac-scented smoke swirls toward the sky.

AC A vintage Alfa Romeo in Sicilian Plum Red CLIPS the ash with
AC its side mirror as it passes rapidly between the two taxis.

AC The hand-stenciled logo of "Valentino's Taxi Servicio" 
AC adorns its somewhat inartfully restored side door panel.

SC EXT. VENICE AIRPORT

AC The ambitious VALENTINO pilots the auto straight into the 
AC Arrivals Gate of the bustling airport.

AC Other waiting operators shout at him for jumping the queue,
AC but Valentino has already spotted his target.

AC As he pinions flush against the curb, the screeching brakes
AC get the attention of LISE FORTUNADO.

AC She smiles behind enormous designer sunglasses.

DL VAL Signora! Benarrivato a Venetia!
DL VAL How does a quick tour around 
DL VAL the Lido sound? Before I take you 
DL VAL to your hotel, Signora!

DL LIS No. I need to get to Il Archivi 
DL LIS Nationale immediately. Do yo know
DL LIS the way?

DL VAL Five minutes! Presto! Entra!

SC EXT. VIA DI MESTRE

AC Minor traffic as Valentino and Lise sit side-by-side.

DL LIS Alfa Classico. Molto bella!

DL VAL I fixed it up myself. Found it in
DL VAL a junk yard when it called out to
DL VAL me: "Valentino, Salva Mia!"

DL LIS And the color? It matches your 
DL LIS sharpa.

DL VAL Tourists come to Venice looking 
DL VAL for life and love and fun and 
DL VAL adventure. I want to remind them 
DL VAL they are someplace special, not 
DL VAL back home in...

DL LIS New York.

DL VAL Ah, well, New York is special. 
DL VAL Like Venice.

DL LIS Ever been?

DL VAL I have never been outside of 
DL VAL Venice, Mrs...

DL LIS Ms. Fortunado. Lise Fortunado.

DL VAL Italiano!

DL LIS American. But my ancestori. 
DL LIS An old Venitian family.
PA LIS (inquisitive)
DL LIS Perhaps you've heard the name? 
PA LIS (boldly)
DL LIS Fortunado!

SC EXT. ARCHIVIO STORICO

AC Valentino WHIPS the car through three lanes of traffic and
AC halts, brakes screeching again, flush against the curb.

AC The Beaux-Arts entrance is abuzz as scholars begin their day.

DL VAL When I was little. Mia Nonna. 
DL VAL She had a map she used to show 
DL VAL us! No, not a map...

DL LIS A family tree!

DL VAL Si. "Family tree." At the top, 
DL VAL you know, it said "Adamo et Eva!" 
DL VAL But somewhere in there...
DL VAL That name. I remember. Fortunado!

DL LIS And was there a crest? Attached 
DL LIS to the name?

DL VAL A crest? Yes! A golden heel!

DL LIS Crushing a serpent?

DL VAL Mio Dio! What does it mean?

DL LIS Now, Valentino. Let me ask about 
DL LIS another name. Montresor! Have 
DL LIS you heard it?

DL VAL You jest! 

DL LIS You know it well, I presume.

DL VAL Il Titani del Venetia! Although 
DL VAL few remain. The company moved 
DL VAL to America.

PA LIS (sotto voce)
DL LIS Titans! How they will suffer 
DL LIS like Prometheus!

DL VAL Did you know they started as wine 
DL VAL traders? Right in the Piazza di 
DL VAL Commedia. And now...

DL LIS Titans of industry. Their fame 
DL LIS as resplendant as Fortunado 
DL LIS lies forgotten.

DL VAL You did not come to Venetia to 
DL VAL see the Doges. Or to ride in the 
DL VAL gondola. Or meet a lover.

DL LIS That is right, Valentino! 
DL LIS Revanchi! For my family! 
DL LIS And yours!

AC Lise EXITS the alfa romeo and spots DR. ANTONA GOTFRUNDI who 
AC wheels a large metal Tumi case.

PA LIS (to Valentino)
DL LIS Viva Fortunado!

PA VAL (unsettled)
DL VAL Viva...

AC Valentino PEELS away from the curb. Pronto.

AC Lise turns and gives a triumphant wave to her friend.

SC EXT. MONTRESOR SHAREHOLDERS PARTY

AC The central campus of Montresor's global headquarters has been
AC transformed into the stage of a colossal company celebration.

AC One part Ringling Bros. Circus, one part Iowa State Fair. 
AC Brushed with a subtle veneer of Carnevale di Venetia motifs.

AC A mass of executives, family members and public shareholders
AC revel in the performances and diversions.

AC The games of chance that ring the arena are all themed on 
AC the different industrial divisions of the Montresor 
AC conglomerate: chemical, defense, agricultural, telecom, etc.

AC Off to one side is the giant white Executive Pavillion where the
AC Montresor Empire's High Command enjoy their just fruits.

AC Topping the tent, a 50 foot white banner UNFURLS in the breeze,
AC revealing the Montresor Company Logo: the unique curvilinear
AC bottle shape that for centuries was used to store that rarest 
AC of vintages. 

AC Amontillado!

SC INT. MONTRESOR EXECUTIVE BIG TENT

AC KATY WO, in waitstaff uniform, serves canapes with a giant
AC fake smile. A ring of tipsy and famished executives pick at the
AC tray as it is offered before them.

DL KAT The pink ones are smoked salmon 
DL KAT mousse with a peanut sriracha 
DL KAT glaze. And the green ones are
DL KAT Basque-inspired chive and 
DL KAT potato pintxos.

AC A random MONTRESOR EXECUTIVE grabs a pink one and sniffs.

DL EXE Are they vegan?

DL KAT Absolutely. Chef Grafite jetted in
DL KAT from Venice last night and brought
DL KAT most of his own ingredients with 
DL KAT him on the Gulfstream. Including
DL KAT a special "vegan" lega salmon.

AC The executive shovels several into her mouth. She washes the
AC contents down with a mammoth tankard overflowing with Rose.

AC She hands the empty chalice to Katy.

DL EXE Next year darling, try serving
DL EXE wine in something larger than
DL EXE a mere thimble!

PA EXE (fist pump, stumble)
DL EXE Viva Montresor!

PA KAT (to herself)
DL KAT She that killeth whilst drunk...

AC The manicured fingers of Sales Executive ROSS MINNOW intrude 
AC unwantedly on the small of Katy's back.

PA ROS (overhearing)
DL ROS ...will be hanged once she's sober.

DL KAT Potato mousse? Or, rather...

AC As she moves to escape Ross' clutch, the cup COLLIDES with the
AC tray. Ross is showered with fluffy salmon. Potatos saturated 
AC with Provencal butter cling to his crisp Thomas Pink shirt.

AC In the background, inebriated executives watching this 
AC spectacle howl with glee and commence their own FOOD FIGHT.

AC Some of the collateral bits of the melee reach the pair.

AC Ross grabs Katy's arm, and LEADS her out of the tent.

DL ROS Come on! Let's see if we can't 
DL ROS rustle up something fizzy to 
DL ROS rid us of these stains.

SC EXT. BIG LAWN BEHIND EXECUTIVE TENT

AC ANA MONTRESOR, dressed in waitstaff uniform, is serving
AC the final drink from her tray to a group of debauchees.

AC She spots Ross pulling Katy into the make-shift caterer's
AC compound where food prep and staging take place.

AC And BOLTS after them.

SC INT. CATERING STATION

AC As they enter a dimly-lit storage unit in the back, Ross
AC begins to UNBUTTON his shirt.

AC Katy realizes they are alone. 

AC Ross begins to sidle up to her.

DL ROS Noblesse oblige... 

AC Ana BURSTS upon the scene.

DL ROS Well! If it isn't the scion 
DL ROS herself.

DL ANA Mr. Hernish is it? Chief of 
DL ANA Fertilizer Sales for
DL ANA Europe and the Middle East?

DL ROS Minnow. Aquacultural Equipment. 
DL ROS The Americas.

DL ANA Such a lot of names I'll have 
DL ANA to to remember once I'm
DL ANA running this show. Fortunately,
DL ANA yours is one of the easier ones.

DL ROS If you ever make it out of
DL ROS Hospitality! I do hope you
DL ROS find yourself in Fisheries.
DL ROS Under me and some of my boys.

AC Ross now turns his attention to Ana, his shirt half open.

DL ANA When you sober up in the morning...

DL ROS Let the Montresors hang me!

AC Ross pounces as Ana delivers a swift ROUND-HOUSE kick to his bare 
AC sternum. 

AC He JOLTS backward into a wall of cooking crates as a maelstrom of 
AC heavy pots and pans cascade down onto his head.

DL ROS "No one provokes me..."

AC Ross PASSES OUT.

DL ANA C'mon Katy. They need you upstairs.

DL KAT Me? Why?

DL ANA Dunno. But Ort-Fiend asked for you.
PA ANA (thick transylvanian accent)
DL ANA "Bring the little maus"
DL ANA They need someone to serve
DL ANA drinks to The Board.

DL KAT But I'm covered in salmon!
DL KAT She will have me buried alive!

AC Ana grabs a bottle of seltzer and bar rag from the shelf.

SC INT. CONFERENCE ROOM ATRIUM

AC Katy looking like new holds a tray of silver goblets.
AC While FRAU ORTSTIEN, Director of Hospitality, pours
AC a thick, sweet-looking dessert wine into each one.

DL ORT Gespenstlichkeit!

DL KAT Looks rather treacly for my 
DL KAT taste. I prefer a lite Sancerre.

DL ORT Not the wine dumbkopf! 
DL ORT It means "like a ghost!"
DL ORT You are to enter, serve the 
DL ORT wine and glide out as if
DL ORT you never existed.

PA KAT (hypnotized)
DL KAT "ghost-like"

AC Frau Ortstien finishes pouring and begins stroking Katy's
AC face and hair with her long bejeweled fingers.

AC As Frau Ortstien bends down to whisper her final instructions,
AC Katy's eyes fix SPELLBOUND on the dangling necklace which
AC swings pendulum-like from the neck of Frau Ortstien.

AC ZOOM IN to its pendant symbol, a long isoceles triangle
AC with a blood-red sapphire crescent inlaid into its base.

DL ORT A little mouse. Blind, deaf
DL ORT and insensible to anything
DL ORT they may be discussing in there.

DL KAT "mouse-ghost"

AC The broad wooden doors of the conference room BURST open flooding
AC the darkened atrium with bright light.

SC INT. ANTIQUATED MAPS ROOM,  ARCHIVI NATIONALE

AC Dr. Gotfrundi removes a HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION UNIT from her case.

AC She places it on the Mapreading Table and flicks a switch.

AC She hands Lise an AUGMENTED REALITY VISOR and dons an additional
AC pair herself.

AC The ancient catacombs that lie buried beneath the Old City!
AC Reconstructed into a three-dimensional image and suspended
AC as if by witchcraft in the space between Lise and Dr. Gotfrundi.

SC INT. HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION, CATACOMBS

AC Lise and Dr. Gotfrundi walk into a magnificent antechamber, its
AC walls rendered in a glitchy, vectorized phosphorescent red.

DL GOT This is the latest Lidar infrared data.

AC Lise's attention turns to a smaller closet-like space near one
AC of the back walls. A pixelated blob lies inside.

DL LIS Mio dio! The walled up tomb!

DL GOT I knew you would be thrilled.
DL GOT Congratulations my old friend.

DL LIS Is there any way? I mean, can 
DL LIS it be enhanced?

DL GOT Not without a sub-micron probe.
DL GOT But if you look closely...

DL LIS His arms! So he must have been...

DL GOT Chained to the wall. Insanity
DL GOT would have set in. Then,
DL GOT slow death by asphyxiation. Even
DL GOT today it remains nitrogenated.

DL LIS Don't go in again.

DL GOT But Lise, the excavation begins
DL GOT after Michelmas.

DL LIS Let him sleep. Let this vital 
DL LIS taint remain as it has been
DL LIS these last four centuries.
DL LIS Forgotten!

SC INT. MAP ROOM

AC They remove their headsets and stare hypnotically at the light
AC projection as it SPINS between them.

AC GRADUAL ZOOM right into that infernal Chamber of Death.

AC The blurry image of ancient Fortunado chained to the wall grows
AC ever larger as we hear Lise's cry of revenge:

DL LIS It is time to hasten 
DL LIS the inevitable!

PA GOT (unsure)
DL GOT Vital...taint?

SC INT. BOARD ROOM, MONTRESOR EMPIRE

AC There are no outside members on the Montresor Board of Directors.
AC It is all family.

AC Several generations sit around the large oak table in the center.

AC At the two far ends are the reigning King and Queen: BELLATOR
AC MONTRESOR, currently serving as Chairman, and his wife, SINCERA
AC MONTRESOR, CEO of the corporation.

AC On the walls, a gallery of contemporary paintings of immense
AC power. Represented by the likes of such artists as:
AC Francis Bacon, Lucien Freud, the Chapman Brothers and other
AC masters of the grotesque and grim.

AC Katy Wo glides in soundlessly with her tray of goblets.

PA SIN (in mid discussion)
DL SIN ...And he is at it again! 
DL SIN Blocking our acquisition of
DL SIN Mongolia Copper at the
DL SIN Pan-Asian Eco Forum.

DL BEL It's an oversight committee.
DL BEL They can't actually stop us.

DL SIN That's not the point! His
DL SIN Lordship, The Illustrious Khan
DL SIN of Garika has been a thorn in
DL SIN the side of the Montresor's
DL SIN interests for far too long!

DL BEL I'm having brunch with Mac Bobbi
DL BEL at the Croquet Club next Sunday. 
DL BEL He plays Polo with the Khan!
DL BEL Why don't we...

DL SIN I think it's too late for that.
DL SIN We can't afford another failure
DL SIN like with FlanBev.

DL BEL And why is it my fault we didn't
DL BEL add a Trappist Ale House to 
DL BEL your burgeoning collection?

DL SIN Because now the House of Garika 
DL SIN owns 80% of global brewery 
DL SIN and spirit distribution! That
DL SIN by all rights should be ours!

DL BEL My dear beloved betrothed, 
DL BEL the Montresor family has not
DL BEL sold a drop of spirits since...

DL SIN It's not the beer! My cherished
DL SIN soul mate. It's the channel, the
DL SIN partnerships, the customers, the
DL SIN network and on and on! Just 
DL SIN because I was not born into this 
DL SIN family...

DL BEL Doesn't mean you have not earned
DL BEL the name of Montresor!

DL SIN Viva Montresor!

DL ALL Viva Montresor!

AC The shout breaks Katy's spell and she begins to notice her 
AC bizarre surroundings.

AC Most prominently, an unusual looking DEVICE on the far table.
AC A tall tower of glass and steel with a giant chamber and 
AC pump system surrounded by rubber tubes and capillaries.

PA KAT (to herself)
DL KAT Sweet hookah! Perhaps they'll 
DL KAT permit me to stoke the brazier!

DL SIN How this noble family can suffer
DL SIN the thousand slights provocated
DL SIN upon us by the Khan? Now with
DL SIN this final insult, I have but one
DL SIN final recommendation!

DL BEL No.

DL SIN Yes! The Assassination List!

AC The collective shock of the other members wakes those whose
AC attention had been only perfunctory up until this moment.

AC MADGER MONTRESOR, the grand ancient patriarch of the clan,
AC and keeper of its institutional history and wisdom, clears
AC his throat to address the assembled Board.

DL MAD Let's consult The Book. If 
DL MAD memory serves the last time
DL MAD we needed to resort to that 
DL MAD illimitable dominion, was more
DL MAD than a decade ago. My father
DL MAD still held the Chair then.
DL MAD American Aquaculture CEO I
DL MAD believe was the unfortunate.

AC Madger gets up to fetch the large leather bound folio that
AC contains the littany of secrets regarding Montresor's rise
AC to infamy and power.

AC On his way toward the shelf, he comes FACE-TO-FACE with Katy.

DL MAD Are you the virgin?

AC The rest of the assembled Board members find this uproarious.

DL SIN It looks like the Grauburgunder
DL SIN Frau Ort-Demon has chosen as
DL SIN our palate cleanser.
PA SIN (sniffs the air)
DL SIN A sickly sweet vintage from
DL SIN the Lower Palatinate,
DL SIN Rhienpfalz, Germany.

DL BEL That should pair nicely with tart
DL BEL virgin blood. 
PA BEL (addressing Katy)
DL BEL And are you from Germany as well?

DL KAT Calif--

DL SIN Silence my mate! She's just
DL SIN the server. I've picked an
DL SIN exquisite French-Moroccan specimen
DL SIN for the ceremony.

DL MAD Moroccan! A hint of Saffron
DL MAD no doubt! Well let's get on
DL MAD with it then.

DL BEL Yes, a magnificent thirst is 
DL BEL upon me! We will consult 
DL BEL The List while toasting with 
DL BEL fresh virgin blood!

DL SIN Very well!
PA SIN (to Katy)
DL SIN After you finish serving tell
DL SIN Frau Ortstien to send in The
DL SIN Curates with The Virgin.

DL KAT Very well, Madame Montresor.

DL SIN Did you hear, she called me
DL SIN Madame!

AC The entire table finds this new gag just as raucous.

AC Katy finishes placing a goblet in front of each member while
AC trying to avoid eye contact and be as INVISIBLE as possible.

DL BEL Something tells me the little
DL BEL mouse's blood would go well...

DL SIN Enough! She's already heard.

AC Sincera grabs Katy's arm as she is exiting with the empty tray.

PA SIN (staring deep into Katy's eyes)
DL SIN Not a word, dear.
DL SIN You are a ghost.
PA SIN (putting a finger to her lips)
DL SIN Shhhhhhhh.

AC Katy opens the gigantic doors and is greeted by two tall CURATES
AC in priestly dress. Standing between them is a YOUNG VIRGIN decked
AC in a white silk robe. A heavy lustrous necklace dangles from her
AC neck with the symbol of the Montresors: 

AC The Amontillado Bottle!

AC Frau Ortstien ushers Katy out and the Ceremonial Party in.

PA ORT (to Katy)
DL ORT Leave.

AC Frau Ortstien begins closing the heavy doors behind her. 

AC Sincera initiates the formalities of the ceremony.

AC A distracted Frau Ortstien accidentally leaves the door open a
AC tiny crack.

AC Affording Katy a hidden view of the ritual!

AC Frau Ortstien helps the Curates hook the young woman up to an
AC intraveneous tube on the transfusion device. They pull up
AC the sleeve of her robe and tie off her arm with one of the
AC rubber hoses. As they search for a vein...

AC Katy stealthily removes a Samsung X phone from her back pocket.

AC She FILMS the proceedings through the tiny gap.

PA KAT (whispering)
DL KAT For the love of God, Montresor!

SC EXT. EDEN RESORT, SRI LANKA

AC Tropical heaven. Oceanfront bungalows shimmer in the heat
AC as the trade winds massage 30 meter tall coconut trees.

AC Along the shallows, verteran fisherman cast hand made nets
AC from dugout wooden outrigger canoes. This is the Lanka of two
AC millenia ago.

AC On the beach in front of them is a pastel pink stilt house
AC suspended high over the crystal azure waters.

AC Its roof is a jumble of antennae, wires and satellite dishes.

AC The PURR of an alternating current transformer that supplies
AC power to the inhabitants of the house from a solar array and 
AC hydrogen fuel cell energy unit signals its uniqueness in the
AC unchanging landscape.

AC A tiny motor boat approaches the house and spins at its ladder
AC which descends from the grand veranda, right into the water.

AC Lise Fortunado expertly pilots the skiff adjacent to the house's
AC empty docking station and ties her main line onto a waiting
AC shiny metal cleat.

DL LIS Permission to come ashore!

SC INT. EDEN BUNGALOW - AFTERNOON

AC The Hacker Haus of the notorious elite Swedish programmer known
AC only as PIM. But rather than a den of empty soda cans and dvds,
AC it is appointed in minimalist white Nordic Modern furniture, with
AC distinctive Colombine flourishes: a basket of papayas, batik silks.

AC In the center is a 14-seat Finn Juhl glass dining table. On top
AC of which sits a black robotic drone hooked up to an oscilloscope.

AC Two long work tables hold single high powered gaming laptops each.

AC Twin giant 30-inch monitors display running streams of
AC financial, network, social media and military data.

AC At one table sits Pim's colleague, PEPE. He is typing Assembly
AC code into a keyboard as fast as he can mentally design it.

AC From his giant Sennheiser headphones, the faint sounds of an
AC atonal Pierre Boulez cantata bleed into the room.

DL LIS It's amazing Pim! Full 3D
DL LIS holographic reconstruction.
DL LIS And with the augmented reality
DL LIS system it's like...the metaverse.

DL PIM You're amazing, Lise. I won't
DL PIM ask what you had to do.

DL LIS Nothing really. An old friend
DL LIS owed me a favor.

DL PIM The critical first step of my
DL PIM magnum opus! We still have to get
DL PIM the sub-micron Lidar probe to
DL PIM the team in Mayadun. Then get the
DL PIM data back out once its captured...

DL LIS Well if anyone can, it's you Pim!
DL LIS Should you be revealing all this
DL LIS in front of him? Or me for that
DL LIS matter?

DL PIM Don't worry about Pepe. He's 
DL PIM jacked in. And you? I know you
DL PIM can keep secrets down through 
DL PIM the centuries!

PA LIS (mesmerized by the code)
DL LIS Just for lulz?

DL PIM Stux Net. Part Deux. 
DL PIM You don't want to know who the
DL PIM target is this time.

DL LIS I'll use my imagination.

DL PIM All I can say is our benefactor 
DL PIM desires neither security, nor
DL PIM justice. But Revenge!

DL LIS My favorite! Who's the client?

DL PIM Unit Eighty Six Hundred.

DL LIS Pity it's not our friends on
DL LIS the Garikan Peninsula. We could
DL LIS kill two birds...

DL PIM Yes. About that. The details of
DL PIM your meeting have been changed.

DL LIS Pim. If you...

DL PIM Relax. It's good news, Lise! The
DL PIM Khan of Garika himself has 
DL PIM sanctioned you an upgrade.

DL LIS I'm listening.

DL PIM Dr. Lung.

DL LIS Minister of Security?

DL PIM That was his old job. He's now
DL PIM running Garikan cyber command. 
DL PIM Very few outside the regime
DL PIM are aware they even have such 
DL PIM a unit. But, it's reputation...

DL LIS Capable?

DL PIM Dark. Unfathomed.

DL LIS Good.

SC INT. EDEN BUNGALOW - SUNSET

AC The oscilloscope has been unplugged and put away, but the blinking
AC red lights of the black spherical drone keep continual watch over
AC the dining table. 

AC It has been pushed to the far side as a grand Lankan feast has been
AC laid out: whole rock lobsters, fish and egg curry, veggie
AC fritters and tempura seaweed.

AC Lise, Pepe and Pim are sopping up the last remnants of sambai
AC and coconut chutney with bits of roast paan bread.

PA PEP (telling his tale)
DL PEP ...After Goldamort was caught,
DL PEP Secret Service began to hone in
DL PEP on our location. If it wasn't
DL PEP for Pim's Army extracting me
DL PEP I'd probably be in a windowless 
DL PEP basement at Fort Meade right
DL PEP about now, instead of Eden!

DL PIM Purely selfish on my part.
DL PIM It was during the Franco
DL PIM Bank raid. And I needed an
DL PIM accomplice. You know, Lise?
DL PIM The ability in this world,
DL PIM to be able to spot raw talent.

DL LIS Is that what you were Pepe? Raw?

DL PEP I don't know about the 
DL PEP talent part. But I lacked polish
DL PEP and sophistication. I was a 
DL PEP cyber pirate, sailing the binary 
DL PEP seas for anarchy and digital booty.
DL PEP Pim taught me to be proud of my 
DL PEP work. He showed me its importance
DL PEP in the sweep of history.

DL LIS From what insane root have you
DL LIS been feeding this poor lad, Pim?

DL PIM Just the finest fresh ceylon
DL PIM ginger paste. Our fish curry 
DL PIM tonite is saturated with it.

DL LIS It's phenomenal! Local? I mean
DL LIS is it indigenous to this Bay?

DL PIM Caught about forty meters outside
DL PIM our dock. The resort uses only
DL PIM sustainable resources.

DL PEP Now they do.

DL PIM In the course of our research
DL PIM into Montresor we discovered an
DL PIM enormous hatchery operation that
DL PIM was disrupting the local fish
DL PIM market ecosystem.

DL PEP And suddenly there was a glitch
DL PEP in their cage door controller.
DL PEP Some unseen hand caused it to
DL PEP swing wide open around 4:20 A.M!

DL PIP Mother ocean wants you back 
DL PIP little fiskas!

DL LIS Down with Montresor.

DL PEP Lise, do you mind me asking?

DL LIS You want to know the root of my
DL LIS obsession with the Montresor
DL LIS Empire, Pepe?

DL PEP It's just...our inquiries have
DL PEP been exhaustive. Our GCHQ work isn't
DL PEP even this rigorous.

DL PIM I remember, that bleak December. 
DL PIM The El Dorado Casino and Hotel. 
DL PIM Las Vegas.

DL LIS Pepe does not need to hear that.

DL PIM Why ever not? One of your 
DL PIM proudest moments Mata Hari!

DL LIS Assignment: Infiltrate DEFCON!

DL PEP Sweet.

DL PIM I was presenting that oblong box
DL PIM thing.

DL LIS The "Re-Gurgitator!"

DL PIM "De-Intermediator." Still doesn't
DL PIM work quite right. I was nervous
DL PIM the night before. Pacing the
DL PIM hallways outside my room.
DL PIM Weak and weary. When out of
DL PIM the blue pops this insane Kandi
DL PIM Raver Kid!

DL LIS My sources said you were Absolut 
DL LIS into electronic music at the time.

DL PIM Swedish electro house is very
DL PIM different than that PLUR...

DL LIS Whatever! Armed with my six inch
DL LIS platforms and fishnets I wasn't
DL LIS gonna be ignored!

DL PIM She asked me to be a gentleman.
DL PIM And help her "remove her boots!"

DL PEP And that worked? She could have
DL PEP been NSA!

DL PIM I knew all along what she was.

DL LIS Yeah right! It was only the next
DL LIS morning when you accessed my
DL LIS Gmail and found the fat dossier
DL LIS I had on Pim, The Shadow. Most
DL LIS ungentlemanly like!

DL PIM Still. You were impressed.

DL LIS When I saw how easily you got
DL LIS into my ahem, folders. I knew 
DL LIS I had found the one.

DL PEP Are we still talking about
DL PEP hacking here?

DL PIM Turned out she's layers more 
DL PIM insidious than NSA. Absolut!

DL LIS What can I say? I was selfish.
DL LIS I needed a member of the elite.

SC INT. MONTRESOR BOARD ROOM

AC The transfusion machine is now brimming with several pints of
AC freshly harvested virgin blood.

AC Frau Ortstien removes a long needle from the arm of the virgin
AC who COLLAPSES into the attending Curates. She is weak from
AC her ample donations.

AC POV SHOT through Katy's phone screen of the ritual.

AC Frau Ortstien decants glasses of the frothy red liquid.

AC Sincera Montresor serves each member while invoking a mysterious
AC and haunting incantation.

AC Toasts are made. Short passages of Medieval Italian verse are
AC recited from The Book.

AC SHOUTS of "Viva Montresor!" resound from the room into the
AC atrium where Katy remains silently filming.

PA SIN (interrupting loudly)
DL SIN What's the matter with her!

AC The virgin CONVULSES and slips through the arms of the Curates.

AC She lands on the floor HARD. Then after a final twitch, lies 
AC utterly still.

AC Madger RISES to investigate. 

DL MAD Ah. Looks like we've taken too
DL MAD much. Make a note of it. Next
DL MAD time we'll need two virgins.

PA KAT (whispers)
DL KAT There won't be a next time.

DL BEL Is she?

DL MAD "To the kingdom, by the sea."

DL SIN Perhaps this gives us an
DL SIN opportunity. Shall we invoke 
DL SIN the Rites of Nero?

AC The mention of a so dark and ancient a custom sends a SHUDDER
AC through the assembled congregation.

AC Yet still, a slow chant begins to emerge:

DL ALL Nero. Nero. Nero.

AC The chants grow louder gradually as the board members begin to 
AC rise from their seats around the conference table.

AC Katy steels herself to keep filming, despite the preponderance of
AC terror that is now coursing through her veins.

DL SIN Bring her into... 
DL SIN The Amorata Chamber!

AC Madger walks to a bookcase lining the far wall and runs his hand
AC over the top row of tomes. He pauses at a slim, red volume near
AC the center and pulls it out abruptly.

AC A wall panel slides open to reveal a large bedroom inside. The
AC furnishings and linens are all black. And in its center lies a
AC mammoth iron-wrought four-poster bed.

AC The Curates, with the help of the other family members, carry the
AC insensible virgin into the inner chamber which shuts behind them.

AC As Katy stops filming, every instinct tells her to flee. But 
AC her curiosty beckons her to cross the Board Room and press her
AC ear against the sealed-in hidden wall.

AC CLOSE UP look of sheer DREAD as she listens to the silent but 
AC dreadful proceedings within. It is left to the imagination 
AC what particular iniquities the "Rites of Nero" may entail!

AC After a BEAT, Katy remembers herself and her surroundings and
AC begins a zombiesque walk back toward the Atrium.

AC When suddenly an entrancing object lying on the conference room
AC table catches her attention.

AC She GRABS hold of The Montresor Book, containing the vast history
AC of the family's secrets and transgressions. 

AC Katy RUNS out the door with The Book tucked under her arm.

SC INT. EDEN BUNGALOW, SRI LANKA - NIGHT

AC The dishes have all been cleared from the table. As well as the
AC drone. Its only occupant is the silver metal Tumi case that 
AC previously belonged to Dr. Gotfrundi in Venice.

AC Although not privy to the post-prandial tales Lise has been 
AC spinning regarding her fixation with the Montresor Empire,
AC their effects may be gleaned from the current scene.

AC Pepe sits back at his workstation, typing much SLOWER now. 
AC He peers over his shoulder at frequent intervals.

AC The veranda double doors are all wide open. As are all the windows. 
AC Pim and Lise SLOW DANCE on the porch outside. Not to music, but
AC the tidal rhythm of cresting waves washing ashore.

DL LIS Is this a dream,
DL LIS within a dream?

DL PIM El Dorado. Part deux.

DL LIS I almost wish...

DL PIM Si, caro...

DL LIS I know if I asked. Just remained
DL LIS here with you forever. We could
DL LIS forget about the world...

DL PIM The world has a habit of 
DL PIM intruding. Even here.

AC An ALARM on Pim's workstation begins flashing.

DL PIM Especially here.

AC He unlocks from Lise and runs over. A few clicks and up pops an 
AC aerial view rendered in high resolution infrared night vision.

DL PEP Is it the Crimean recon thing?

DL PIM Nope. Stunning Octagon.

DL PEP Who comes up with these code 
DL PEP names?

PA PIM (looking out at Lise)
DL PIM A lonely man. In a windowless
DL PIM sub-basement. Surrounded by
DL PIM six foot thick concrete walls.

DL PEP You need me to...

DL PIM I've got this.

AC Pim grabs a military-grade joystick and headset unit.

AC Lise walks over and sees the screen.

DL LIS I'll just get ready for bed.
DL LIS Take your time.

AC Lise kisses the seated Pim on the head and exits.

DL PIM This should be over in a flash.

PA PEP (whispering)
DL PEP How well do you really know her?

DL PIM She is exactly who she says she
DL PIM is. One of the few that do.

DL PEP But you heard what she was
DL PEP saying. "Long bouts of
DL PEP horrible sanity!"

DL PIM When I met you Pepe, you were
DL PIM trashing the reputations of 
DL PIM model citizens. Just for laughs.

DL PEP Yes! Anarchy for anarchy's sake.
DL PEP But this...

DL PIM What then?

DL PEP El diablo.

AC Lise GLIDES back in wearing a black gossamer robe.

DL LIS I changed my mind, Sotnos.
PA LIS (lit. "sweetnose," in Swedish)
DL LIS I want to watch.

AC Pim looks at Pepe. But addresses Lise as she climbs into his lap.

DL PIM Before I forget.

AC He loops a lanyard around her neck. Attached is a THUMB DRIVE
AC with a secure hardware encryption fob at one end.

DL PIM It's set to yur iris scan
DL PIM Only your all seeing eye 
DL PIM can unlock it.

DL LIS The Montresor Smorgasbord!

DL PIM The crown jewels. The Sun.
DL PIM The Moon... 

DL LIS And The Stars!

AC Lise expresses her gratitude with a SHOWER of affection.

AC In bright phosphorescent green, Pim's screen flashes with the
AC message: "TARGET LOCK ACQUIRED."

SC EXT. EDEN BAY INLET, SRI LANKA - DAWN

AC Lise is standing in her small speed boat, piloting the skiff away
AC from the shore and out into the open waters.

AC In the fore section, the black spherical drone from Pim's lair
AC sits well secured with elastic cords and a tarp.

AC PAN UP to reveal Lise's destination: an anchored MEGA YACHT.
AC It commands an intimidating presence amongst the traditional 
AC square-sailed catamarans that criss-cross the bay.

AC As she approaches, a single armed GUARD appears on deck and speaks
AC into a walkie-talkie while waving her in.

SC INT. ANA MONTRESOR'S APARTMENT

DL KAT I had no where else...

DL ANA Katy, I grew up in this psycho
DL ANA family. Since I was a baby my
DL ANA parents spoke of my 
DL ANA "initiation" into its rites.

PA KAT (shaking)
DL KAT Desolation! And dimmest night!

DL ANA Please. Calm down. You can trust
DL ANA me Katy.

DL KAT Can I? Your blood is their blood.

DL ANA Why do you think I work my way
DL ANA up from the bottom, rather than
DL ANA taking the gilded path they 
DL ANA dangle before me?

DL KAT I know, you've said it before.
DL KAT You want to change things at 
DL KAT Montresor. Change the world.

DL ANA And once the world bears witness
DL ANA to their unholy machinations!

DL KAT But this Ana! Atrocities!

DL ANA Show me. The Book. Is it in 
DL ANA your bag?

DL KAT Yes.

AC Ana removes the folio from Katy's oversized handbag.

DL KAT Until you see, you won't believe.

AC Katy pulls her phone from her back pocket and PLAYS the video she
AC recorded earlier.

AC Ana watches in a trance of curiosity mixed with revulsion.

AC She stops it within seconds. Then runs to her bathroom to be sick.

AC After, they sit huddled together on the sofa. Survivors of a
AC shared trauma. 

AC Ana leafs through the leather bound codex page by page.

AC She lets every morbid detail of her family history sink in.

DL ANA When we were young Madger would 
DL ANA scold us at family get-togethers.
DL ANA "If you don't straighten up.
DL ANA You're name will wind up in The
DL ANA Book!" I was too frightened to
DL ANA ask what it possibly meant.

DL KAT Do you remember any of the
DL KAT language? From your summers
DL KAT in Venice?

DL ANA It's not modern. It's a mix
DL ANA of Latin and Renaissance words.

DL KAT The drawings suffice.

DL ANA And something else. Mumbo-jumbo,
DL ANA gobbledeygook, nonsense phrases.
DL ANA Almost like...

DL KAT Spells?

DL ANA Incantations, perhaps.

DL KAT I heard Sincera utter something. 
DL KAT Whle she was serving.

DL ANA Did you get it on tape?

DL KAT Yeah, baby. So what's next?

DL ANA Next? We need to get this
DL ANA translated.

DL KAT Do you remember that site Prof.
DL KAT Annabelli showed us? During our
DL KAT Early French Lit class?

DL ANA The Digital Rabelais Project?

DL KAT Yup. Distributed crowd
DL KAT translation. Courtesy of the
DL KAT cloud.

DL ANA You didn't happen to bring a
DL ANA scanner with you by chance?

PA KAT (thinking)
DL KAT FedEx Office Store?

SC INT. 24HR FEDEX OFFICE STORE - NIGHT

AC Ana runs interference, expertly distracting two graveyard
AC shift EMPLOYEES. 

AC Meanwhile, Katy multitasks:

AC She OPERATES the flat bed scanner, capturing each infernal page.

AC CLEANS up the scanned pages using bitmap enchancing software. 

AC RUNS the post-processed images through a state-of-the-art optical 
AC character recognition program.

AC FEEDS the resulting text into an Italian-English machine 
AC translation interface.

AC And POLISHES the output text into something humans can decipher.

AC All while simultaneously UPLOADING the secret video from her 
AC phone's SD card to a public video hosting site where it is
AC TRANSCODED to common mobile web viewable formats.

AC Glimpses of The Book's pages flash on screen.

AC From the Renaissance through the 21st Century, the secrets of the
AC Montresors at long last: digitized for posterity!

SC INT. NARITA AIRPORT V.I.P. LOUNGE, TOKYO, JAPAN

AC Lise BOWS upon meeting delegates from the Republic of Garika.

AC She inspects a buffet of congealed miso soup, sickly-looking sushi, 
AC tepid green tea and chilled off-brand saki. She grabs a plate.

AC Lise eats cautiously, attempting to fill heself. Unsure of what
AC the Garikan food situation will be like, she secrets a few packets
AC of oyster crackers into her carry-on.

AC IVOR introduces himself as Lise's security escort.

SC EXT. RUNWAY, NARITA AIRPORT - NIGHT

AC The Garikan Welcome Commitee walks Lise briskly onto the chilly
AC tarmac, where a BOEING BUSINESS CLASS JET is finishing its
AC refueling and pilot check procedures.

AC Two awaiting FLIGHT ATTENDANTS bow as Lise steps onto the ladder.

AC They exchange a wicked smirk as Lise disappears into the cabin.

SC INT. HOTEL SOFITEL, AMSTERDAM

AC Katy and Ana have fled the country and set up a temporary Black
AC Ops HQ in the Schermerhorn Suite.

AC SCREEN POV of them registering the domain name "montresor.wtf" 
AC and HIGH-FIVING.

AC They don GUY FAWKS' MASKS as they set up a camera and prepare
AC to record an anonymous video statement.

SC EXT. K-101 MOTORWAY, GARIKAN CAPITOL - MORNING

AC Ivor drives a black Mercedes G-85 Jeep. Lise sits by his side,
AC staring mesmerized out her window.

AC The cityscape of the isolated authoritarian regime is as foreign
AC to Lise as the moonscape of Mare Tranquilium.

AC Centuries of sustainable cultural development mixed with abundant
AC natural resource wealth and a persistent, xenophobic disdain of
AC outside influence has resulted in a civil architecture at once
AC disorienting yet seductive.

AC And yet, oddly familiar too. Certain motifs begin to stand out:

AC An ongoing Art Festival that resembles the Biennale.

AC A Lido-like beach promenade. 

AC Elements of Moorish, Gothic, and Byzantine architecture 
AC swirling together.

AC And as they stop at an intersection, an ELECTRIC GONDOLA with
AC an elegant aristocratic couple in its basket speeds past.

AC Lise follows the conveyance with her eyes and spots a restaurant
AC across the avenue with a curious name: Fortuna's Grille.

AC Even more beguiling to her sight is its insignia above the
AC awning. A golden heel crushing a well-fanged serpent!

AC Could it be? The final sanctuary of those noble families of
AC Venice who fled the rise of Montresor?

AC Out of pure habit, Lise lifts her camera phone to take a SNAPSHOT.

AC Ivor quickly confiscates the phone while shaking his head.

SC INT. CYBER COMMAND, GARIKAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE

AC Lise is the first foreigner ever to step foot in the digital
AC War Room, as impressive as anything one would find at 
AC Langley or the River House.

AC Although the cadre of busy analysts eye Lise wearily, she is
AC greeted with enthusiasm by the esteemed DR. LUNG, Director.

AC Lise takes the lanyard with encrypted thumb drive from around her
AC neck as Dr. Lung BEAMS with triumph.

SC INT. FREEWORLD INTERNET CAFE, AMSTERDAM

AC Ana and Katy use the busy cafe's Wifi to conduct their first
AC voice-scrambled telephone interview with the media.

AC As they congratulate themselves on a job well done, Katy
AC excuses herself and walks to the restroom.

AC From her bag she pulls out a phone. Different from the one she
AC used before.

AC She initiates a VIDEO CHAT. The recipiant at the other end of 
AC the call is none other than Ivor, the Garkian Security Agent!

SC INT. NEURO-OPTOGENICS LAB, GARIKAN CYBER COMMAND

AC The human brain is the ultimate information processing machine.

AC An array of genetically modified super-soldiers with elongated 
AC skulls lie in shallow vats of translucent warm bubbling goo.

AC Hair thin fibre optic cables attachted directly to their frontal
AC neo-cortical lobes pulsate with neural activity.

AC Monitors display the velocity and economy of their computing
AC capabilities.

AC Dr. Lung looks on with pride.

AC Lise expresses a mixture of wonder and fright.

AC Dr. Lung opens the encrypted thumb drive's security bracket as
AC Lise bends down to let its red laser SCAN her pupil. 

AC It glows green with recognition as it is unlocked.

SC. INT. CYBERSPACE

AC The Garikan-flavored, human-machine hybrid super-intelligence
AC begins DISSECTING the labyrinth of Montresor's capital holdings.

AC A convolution of off-shore accounts, synthetic corporations and
AC dark pools of financial assets is probed to find vulnerabilities.

AC Bit by infinitesimal bit, The Agent begins placing market orders
AC against Montresor's interests.

AC With every high frequency trade executed, the share price of 
AC publicly traded Montresor stock decreases by a slight tick.

AC The profits generated by the trades are siphoned into a single
AC brokerage account at the Swiss-based Bank of Helvetica.

SC INT. KHAN ROYAL HOTEL, GURIKAN CAPITOL CITY

AC Lise is exhausted as she jams the key card into the outer door
AC of her hotel suite.

AC She is SHOCKED as she opens the door and sees Pim and Pepe inside.

AC They nod nonchalantly and continue typing away at their laptops.

AC Lise drops her bags and runs over to embrace Pim.

AC She stops short when she notices the images displayed on a 
AC television newscast: "BLOOD OF THE MONTRESORS!"

SC EXT. HELVETICA BANK, ZURICH

AC Ivor exits the bank's main doors and climbs into the back seat
AC of a Maybach limo idling at the curb.

AC Group video chat using the car's built in electronic dash. Among
AC the faces present are Dr. Lung and Katy Wo. 

AC Ivor gives them all a big double thumbs up!

SC INT. MONTRESOR BOARD ROOM

AC Madger SHOUTS into a Polycom VoiceStation audio conferencing unit
AC that lies silent on the heavy table. Whomever it was he was
AC speaking to, has hung up.

AC Sincera and Bellator look on in bewilderment and horror.

AC Madger steps over to the bookshelf and unlocks the mechanism
AC opening the secret chamber within.

AC He enters and pulls a Venetian-crafted antique Astra A-80 
AC semi-automatic pistol from the bedside drawer.

AC Bellator RUNS in his direction shouting while Sincera buries
AC her face in her hands.

SC EXT. MONTRESOR MANOR

AC CLOSE UP on the blood-drained faces of Sincera and Bellator
AC Montresor locked in a deep final kiss.

AC They pull apart. Bellator gives a signal to someone waiting
AC offscreen.

AC Frau Ortstien nods and pulls a lever.

AC A gigantic SCYTHE attached to a PENDULUM swings downward!

AC CUT TO BLACK

AC The faint sounds of strained, phlegmatic coughing echo in the 
AC darkness.

SC INT. CATACOMBS, VENICE

AC FORTUNADO, riven with insanity, choking on the nitre fumes that
AC emanate from the damp, ancient walls, slowly SUFFOCATES to death.

AC He knows he is near the end. The words "Amontillado" and 
AC "Montresor" escape from his lips in the faintest of whispers.

AC A light BREEZE hits his face and ruffles his hair.

AC With the last of his strength he lifts his head to see the mason
AC wall that had sealed him in is GONE!

AC In the antechanber, standing before him, is the immense figure of
AC an imposing giant clad in Imperial Roman armor. 

AC This is HADES, God of the Underworld. 

AC In his colossal right hand he wields the divine Spear of Triam.

AC He points it at the quivering Fortunado and BELLOWS:

DL HAD Awaken mortal!

DL FOR Death? Is that you?

DL HAD The Shades and Demons inhabiting
DL HAD my Underworld feed on the
DL HAD rancor hidden in the hearts of
DL HAD men such as you. Come!

AC Fortunado's chains dissolve into thin air as he DROPS to his
AC knees. He stands up cautiously and approaches, still not quite
AC believing the incredible sight before him.

DL FOR Toward that villain Montresor!
DL FOR There is enough enmity in my
DL FOR soul for your legion to feast
DL FOR for a thousand centuries!

DL HAD You need not wait so long.

DL FOR How?

DL HAD I will grant you a vision. 
DL HAD The House of Montresor will
DL HAD enjoy a brief respite before
DL HAD Fortunado rises again. 

PA FOR (gaining in strength)
DL FOR Viva. Fortunado.

DL HAD Now follow me. Torrents of
DL HAD Amontillado await you in the
DL HAD cellars of my Kingdom! Come and
DL HAD slake your unholy and bottomless
DL HAD thirst for Eternity!

DL FOR Amontillado!

DL HAD Amontillado!

AC Laughing, they DESCEND together through the floor and into the
AC depths of the Underworld.

FO FADE OUT
