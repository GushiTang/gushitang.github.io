SC INT. BALTIMORE OPERA HOUSE - DAY

AC This is it.

AC Center of the universe. Ground zero. Origin of life. The place to be. And be seen.

AC CLOSE in on an enormous rectangular banner composed in the High Swiss modern style of
AC legendary poster artist, Joseph Mueller-Brockman. 

AC Its hypnotic message reads simply: THE 1959 BALTIMORE RECORD FAIR!

AC Even though Le Nozze Di Figaro was packing in the City's dapper do's just last week,
AC the Orchestra Pit and Floor Seats have all been cleared away to make room for:

AC Row upon row of exhibition booths. All devoted to the craft of making hit records.

AC CRANE SHOT down from the ceiling. KEY IN on VALAREE, Early 20s. Wearing nothing but
AC black form-fitting clothes and ballet flats as her armor. And wielding only a brand 
AC new Pentax 35mm camera as her weapon of choice.
