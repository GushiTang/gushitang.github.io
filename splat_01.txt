SC INT. LYRIC OPERA HOUSE, BALTIMORE - DAY

AC CLOSE on a giant banner that spans the entire stage. Composed in the hypnotic style
AC of legendary Swiss poster artist, Joseph Mueller-Brockman. It reads simply: 

AC                      THE 1959 BALTIMORE RECORD FAIR

AC STEADICAM a yard or two behind VALAREE and LOX as they pass down a row of exhibitors.

AC Valaree (21) dressed in beatnik black capri pants, espadrills and a beret. The only 
AC incongruity in her wardrobe is an "Eternal Love Record's" tee shirt. She lugs a 
AC canvas bag brimming with swag over her shoulder. A camera strap attached to a 35mm 
AC Pentax is looped around her neck.

AC Lox (20) sports the "Gravedigger" style common to the Teen Death Cult fans who adore
AC Eternal Love's issues. Black drainpipe tuxedo pants, dark brocade waistcoat, 
AC antique pocketwatch and thick-soled leather boots. A large button with the Eternal 
AC Love logo: a broken heart with angel's halo inscribed on a tombstone. He carries a 
AC stack of 45 records in paper sleeve jackets.
