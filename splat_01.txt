SC INT. LYRIC OPERA HOUSE, BALTIMORE - DAY

AC CLOSE on a giant banner that spans the entire stage. Composed in the hypnotic style
AC of legendary Swiss poster artist, Joseph Mueller-Brockman. It reads simply: 

AC                      THE 1959 BALTIMORE RECORD FAIR

AC Even though Mozart and Figaro were packing in the City's dapper do's just last week,
AC the Orchestra Pit and Floor Seats have all been disassembled to make way for the
AC largest recording industry trade show in the Universe!

AC STEADICAM a yard behind VALAREE and ZAN, founders of the Eternal Love Records label,
AC as they shimmy and slide down an endless row of exhibitors.

AC Valaree (21) dressed in "Beatnik" black capri pants, espadrills and a beret. And, of
AC course, a rare, first-edition "Eternal Love Record's" tee shirt. She lugs a canvas
AC bag brimming with swag over her shoulder. A camera strap attached to a 35mm Pentax
AC is looped around her neck.

AC Zan (20) sports the "Gravedigger" style common to the Teen Death Cult fans who adore
AC Eternal Love's issues. Black drainpipe tuxedo pants, dark brocade waistcoat, 
AC antique pocketwatch and thick-soled leather boots. A large button with the Eternal 
AC Love logo: a broken heart with angel's halo inscribed on a tombstone. He carries a 
AC stack of 45 records in paper sleeve jackets.

AC And its not just the cream of the nascent hit record making music industry. But also 
AC folks Zan and Val consider to be their friends and collaborators, despite their youth. 
AC They greet every one they meet with affection and gratitude. 

AC Handing out records. Accepting tchotchkes. Living the life.
